# ROS Dependency Bug Checkers


Static bug checkers for [ROS](http://www.ros.org) packages developed as part of [SQUARE](https://github.com/itu-square) research at the IT University of Copenhagen.

All the bugs explored are dependency-related bugs, leading to run-time failures when the ROS packages are installed and executed. 

Find individual READMEs for checkers at:

- [`bash`](/bash-checker)
- [`.launch`](/launch-checker)
- [`python`](/python-checker)
